## Eurotours website

Eurotours is a fictional new travel company specialising in european city breaks. They will help clients choose create a tailor made holiday including flights, accomodation and help put together an itinerary

### Potential visitors
Potential visitors will drawn in by some visually appealing images of the travel destinations on offer. as they work their way through the site they will be given information on the company and how the company can help create a tailor made holiday, they will be given information on destinations available and some potential attractions to add to an itinerary and the visitor will also be given a means by which to contact the company

#### User experience
Initially i had wanted to do a multi page website but as the development progressed it became more visually effective to create a one page website with a particular concentration on how the website will work on mobile

##### Website features
**Navbar**
 I wanted to create a visually appealing logo to be the focal point of the navbar. I created this logo on 
<a href="https://www.freelogodesign.org">freelogodesign.org</a>
I wanted to create a visually appealing hover action for the other elements

**Carousel**
Here the aim was to have several high resolution cityscape images of the various locations on offer. I sourced these images from <a href="www.unsplash.com">unsplash.com</a>

**About**
i wanted to keep this section clear and concise and display to the potential customer what exactly the company is offering

**Destinations**
Here i wanted to use a google maps api in combination with some bootstrap cards to create a section where the user could search for specific locations in the city they plan to visit and get more detailed information about the locations. This however did not go as well as i thought it would and would definitely be an area for revision in the future.

**Book now**
In this section i created a simple for that can be filled in order for the customer to get started on booking their holiday

**Footer**
The footer section is a simple mirroring of the header that i thought would be act as an extra navigation tool for the user
